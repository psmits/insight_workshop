1. What are the important assumptions of linear regression?

2. You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here?

3. Your linear regression doesnâ€™t run and communicates that there is an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?

4. What are some possible problems with regression models? How do you avoid or compensate for them?

5. Consider the following regression: log(weight) = -3.5 + 2.0 log(height) + error, with errors that have standard deviation 0.25. Weights are in pounds and heights are in inches.
    - Fill in the blanks: approximately 68% of the persons will have weights within a factor of __ and __ of their predicted values from the regression.
    - Draw the regression line and scatterplot of log(weight) versus log(height) that make sense and are consistent with the fitted model. Be sure to label the axes of your graph.

6. Supose that, for a certain population, we can predict log earnings from log height as follows
    - A person who is 66 inches tall is predicted to have hearnings of $30,000.
    - Every incerase in 1% in height corresponds to a predicted increase of 0.8% in earnings
    - The earnings of apprximately 95% of people fall within a factor of 1.1 of predicted values.

    Give the equation of the regression line and the residual standard deviation of the regression.
