<li><p>What are the important assumptions of linear regression?</p></li>
<li><p>You run your regression on different subsets of your data, and in each subset, the beta value for a certain variable varies wildly. What could be the issue here?</p></li>
<li><p>Your linear regression doesnâ€™t run and communicates that there is an infinite number of best estimates for the regression coefficients. What could be wrong?</p></li>
<li><p>What are some possible problems with regression models? How do you avoid or compensate for them?</p></li>
<li>Consider the following regression: log(weight) = -3.5 + 2.0 log(height) + error, with errors that have standard deviation 0.25. Weights are in pounds and heights are in inches.
<ul>
<li>Fill in the blanks: approximately 68% of the persons will have weights within a factor of __ and __ of their predicted values from the regression.</li>
<li>Draw the regression line and scatterplot of log(weight) versus log(height) that make sense and are consistent with the fitted model. Be sure to label the axes of your graph.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Supose that, for a certain population, we can predict log earnings from log height as follows
<ul>
<li>A person who is 66 inches tall is predicted to have hearnings of $30,000.</li>
<li>Every incerase in 1% in height corresponds to a predicted increase of 0.8% in earnings</li>
<li>The earnings of apprximately 95% of people fall within a factor of 1.1 of predicted values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give the equation of the regression line and the residual standard deviation of the regression.</p></li>
