1. Derive Bayes theorem.

2.  The students of a particular class were given two tests for evaluation. Twenty-five percent of the class cleared both the tests and forty-five percent of the students were able to clear the first test. Calculate the percentage of students who passed the second test given that they were also able to pass the first test.

3. About 30% of human twins are identical, and the rest are fraternal. Identical twins are necessarily the same sex, half are males and the other half are females. One-quarter of fraternal twins are both males, one-quarter both female, and one-half are mixed: one male, one female. You have just become a parent of twins and are told they are both girls. Given this information, what is the probability that they are identical?

4. Jack is having two coins in his hand. Out of the two coins, one is a real coin and the second one is a faulty one with Tails on both sides. He blindfolds himself to choose a random coin and tosses it in the air. The coin falls down with Tails facing upwards. What is the probability that this tail is shown by the faulty coin?

5. Balls numbered 1 through 20 are placed in a bag. Three balls are drawn out of the bag without replacement. What is the probability that all the balls have odd numbers on them?

6. HIV is still a very scary disease to even get tested for. The US military tests its recruits for HIV when they are recruited. They are tested on three rounds of Elisa( an HIV test) before they are termed to be positive. The prior probability of anyone having HIV is 0.00148. The true positive rate for Elisa is 93% and the true negative rate is 99%.

    - What is the probability that a recruit has HIV, given he tested positive on first Elisa test? 
    - What is the probability of having HIV, given he tested positive on Elisa the second time as well?
