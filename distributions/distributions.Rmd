## The exponential family



## Uniform distribution



# Discrete probability distributions

## Bernoulli distribution

**probability of "success" from single trial**

Suppose we toss a coin only once. Let \(X \in {0, 1}\) be a binary random variable, with probability of "success" or heads being \(\theta\). 

We say that \(X\) has a **Bernoulli** distribution, written \(X \sim \text{Bern}(\theta)\). The pmf is defined:
\[
\text{Bern}(x | \theta) = 
\begin{cases}
\theta & \text{if } x = 1 \\
1 - \theta & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]



## Binomial distribution part 1

**probability of \(X\) "successes" in \(n\) trials**

Suppose we toss a coin \(n\) times. Let \(X \in {0, \dots, n}\) be the number of heads, with the probability of heads being \(\theta\).

We say \(X\) has a **binomial** distribution, written \(X \sim \text{Bin}(n, \theta)\). The pmf is defined:
\[
\text{Bin}(X | n, \theta) = \binom{n}{X} \theta^{X} (1 - \theta)^{n - X}
\]

**Note:** Bernoulli distribution is special case of Binomial where \(n = 1\)



## Binomial distribution part 2

## Geometric distribution part 1

**number of "failures" before a "success"**

If each pokeball we throw has probability \(1 / 10\) to catch Mew, the number of failed pokeballs will be distributed \(\text{Geom}(1 / 10)\).

Two definitions:

- The probability distribution of the number \(X\) of Bernoulli trials needed to get one success
\[
\text{Pr}(X = k) = (1 - \theta)^{k - 1} p
\]

- The probability distribution of the number \(Y = X - 1\) of failures before the first success
\[
\text{Pr}(Y = k) = (1 - \theta)^{k} p
\]

## Negative Binomial distribution

**number of draws until \(n\) successes**

 is the number of "failures" that we will have before we achieve our rth success. Our successes have probability p.

Thundershock has 60% accuracy and can faint a wild Raticate in 3 hits. The number of misses before Picachu faints Raticate with Thundershock is distributed \(X \sim \text{NBin}(r = 3, p = 0.6)\).




## Hypergeometric distribution

**number of "successes" in a fixed number of trails without replacement**

Drawing a particular type of card from a deck of cards without replacement.



## Poisson distribution

**counts of rare events in unit of space or time**



# Continuous probability distributions

## Normal distribution

## Exponential distribution

## Gamma distribution

## Beta distribution

## Chi-Square distriution
